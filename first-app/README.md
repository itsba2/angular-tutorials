## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## JSON server

Run `npm run json-server` for JSON server, which is required to access the data. Data are served on `http://localhost:3000/locations` by default.

Change relevant line of code in `package.json` to change port. For example, adding `--port 3001` to change port from 3000 to 3001.
